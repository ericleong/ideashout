IdeaShout is a social aggregator for events and ideas, exploring the connection between space and time.

Pitch
-----
> IdeaShout is a social network for clubs focused on fostering communication
> and interaction within the club and with the local community. It helps
> brainstorm ideas through the active sharing of online and offline content,
> which is coupled with commentary by fellow club members. The site is split
> into events, links, and ideas, and members can post in all three sections.
> Events include job fairs, hackathons, and seminars, while links are for
> tutorials and articles found online. Ideas new and old can be posted for
> members to see and critique, allowing great ideas to shine despite the low
> entry barrier. A news feed merges all the content into one simple stream,
> providing members with a simple way to keep tabs on the community. It's
> food for thought for hungry minds.
